# Healing Hearts
## A Cancer Support Platform

Healing Hearts is a cancer support platform that provides cancer patients and their families with reliable and comprehensive information about different types of cancer, available treatment options, support resources, and a community of individuals who share similar experiences.

The platform addresses the problem of the lack of accessible and trustworthy information about cancer and its related resources. Cancer patients and their families are often overwhelmed with information, leading to confusion, anxiety, and difficulty in making informed decisions about their care. Healing Hearts offers a one-stop source of information and support to alleviate some of the stress and uncertainty associated with a cancer diagnosis and treatment.
